<h1> Geography of US Health Care Industry Payments</h1>
<p>
  The health care industry works together to solve the medical 
  challenges of our day, which sometimes includes covering the costs of
  research, gifts, speaking fees, meals and travel. 
  
  Health care companies are <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/topics/sunshine-act-and-physician-financial-transparency-reports.page">required to disclose</a>
  their financial relationships with doctors and hospitals. The data is made publicly available
  through the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/openpayments/">Open Payments</a> system run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
</p>
<p>
  In the United States in 2013, physicians and hospitals received at least $691 million of financial compensation<sup>*</sup>
  from health care product manufacturers. 
  This interactive map allows you to view the data by company to explore the geographic pattern of payments within the health care industry.
